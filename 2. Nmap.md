## Introduction
###### Say we have been given an IP (or multiple IP addresses) to perform a security audit on. Before we do anything else, we need to get an idea of the “landscape” we are attacking. What this means is that we need to establish which services are running on the targets. For example, perhaps one of them is running a webserver, and another is acting as a Windows Active Directory Domain Controller. The first stage in establishing this “map” of the landscape is something called port scanning. When a computer runs a network service, it opens a networking construct called a “port” to receive the connection.  Ports are necessary for making multiple network requests or having multiple services available. For example, when you load several webpages at once in a web browser, the program must have some way of determining which tab is loading which web page. This is done by establishing connections to the remote webservers using different ports on your local machine. Equally, if you want a server to be able to run more than one service (for example, perhaps you want your webserver to run both HTTP and HTTPS versions of the site), then you need some way to direct the traffic to the appropriate service. Once again, ports are the solution to this. Network connections are made between two ports – an open port listening on the server and a randomly selected port on your own computer. For example, when you connect to a web page, your computer may open port 49534 to connect to the server’s port 443.

Sure, network ports are endpoints used for communication in a network. They allow different devices and applications to connect and exchange data. Here are some clear notes about network ports:

### 1. What is a port?
   - <span style="color:#03fcc2">A port is a virtual endpoint for communication in a network.</span>

   - <span style="color:#03fcc2">It's identified by a numeric value, ranging from 0 to 65535.</span>
### 2. Types of ports:

* **Well-known Ports (0-1023):** Reserved for specific services by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). Examples include:
	* Port 80: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for web browsing.
	* Port 443: HTTPS (HTTP Secure) for secure web browsing.
	* Port 25: SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) for email transmission.
* **Registered Ports (1024-49151):** Intended for user or application-specific services, often registered with IANA. Examples include:
	* Port 3389: Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) for remote access to computers.
	* Port 3306: MySQL database system.
	* Port 8080: Alternative HTTP port often used for proxy servers.
* **Dynamic/Private Ports (49152-65535):** Available for temporary use by client applications for communication with servers. These are not assigned or regulated.
### 3. How ports work?
- <span style="color:#03fcc2">Ports work in conjunction with IP addresses to facilitate communication between devices.</span>

- <span style="color:#03fcc2">When data is sent over a network, it's directed to a specific IP address and port number.</span>
### 4. TCP vs. UDP ports
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):**<span style="color:#FF0000"> Reliable, connection-oriented protocol</span> that uses ports for communication. It ensures data integrity but may be slower due to the overhead of establishing connections.
    - Examples: HTTP, SMTP, FTP (File Transfer Protocol).
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** <span style="color:#FF0000">Faster but less reliable</span>, connectionless protocol. It also utilizes ports for communication but **doesn’t guarantee data delivery**.
    - Examples: DNS (Domain Name System), DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol).

## TCP connect scans

To understand TCP Connect scans (`-sT`), it's important that you're comfortable with the _TCP three-way handshake_. If this term is new to you then completing [Introductory Networking](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtonetworking) before continuing would be advisable.

As a brief recap, the three-way handshake consists of three stages. First the connecting terminal (our attacking machine, in this instance) sends a TCP request to the target server with the SYN flag set. The server then acknowledges this packet with a TCP response containing the SYN flag, as well as the ACK flag. Finally, our terminal completes the handshake by sending a TCP request with the ACK flag set.


 If Nmap sends a TCP request with the _SYN_ flag set to a **_closed_** port, the target server will respond with a TCP packet with the _RST_ (Reset) flag set. By this response, Nmap can establish that the port is closed.
 
![[3 Nmap-20240109192519777.webp|232]]


This is all well and good, however, there is a third possibility.

What if the port is open, but hidden behind a firewall?

Many firewalls are configured to simply **drop** incoming packets. Nmap sends a TCP SYN request, and receives nothing back. This indicates that the port is being protected by a firewall and thus the port is considered to be _filtered_.

That said, it is very easy to configure a firewall to respond with a RST TCP packet. For example, in IPtables for Linux, a simple version of the command would be as follows:

##### iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport [port] -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset.

This can make it extremely difficult (if not impossible) to get an accurate reading of the target(s).


## SYN scans

As with TCP scans, SYN scans (`-sS`) are used to scan the TCP port-range of a target or targets; however, the two scan types work slightly differently. SYN scans are sometimes referred to as "_Half-open"_ scans, or _"Stealth"_ scans.  

Where TCP scans perform a full three-way handshake with the target, SYN scans sends back a RST TCP packet after receiving a SYN/ACK from the server (this prevents the server from repeatedly trying to make the request). In other words, the sequence for scanning an **open** port looks like this:

![[3 Nmap-20240109193107426.webp]]

This has a variety of advantages for us as hackers:

- It can be used to bypass older Intrusion Detection systems as they are looking out for a full three way handshake. This is often no longer the case with modern IDS solutions; it is for this reason that SYN scans are still frequently referred to as "stealth" scans.
- SYN scans are often not logged by applications listening on open ports, as standard practice is to log a connection once it's been fully established. Again, this plays into the idea of SYN scans being stealthy.
- Without having to bother about completing (and disconnecting from) a three-way handshake for every port, SYN scans are significantly faster than a standard TCP Connect scan.

There are, however, a couple of disadvantages to SYN scans, namely:

- They require sudo permissions in order to work correctly in Linux. This is because SYN scans require the ability to create raw packets (as opposed to the full TCP handshake), which is a privilege only the root user has by default.
- Unstable services are sometimes brought down by SYN scans, which could prove problematic if a client has provided a production environment for the test.

All in all, the pros outweigh the cons.

For this reason, SYN scans are the default scans used by Nmap _if run with sudo permissions_. If run **without** sudo permissions, Nmap defaults to the TCP Connect scan we saw in the previous task.

## UDP Scans

Unlike TCP, UDP connections are _stateless_. This means that, rather than initiating a connection with a back-and-forth "handshake", UDP connections rely on sending packets to a target port and essentially hoping that they make it. This makes UDP superb for connections which rely on speed over quality (e.g. video sharing), but the lack of acknowledgement makes UDP significantly more difficult (and much slower) to scan. The switch for an Nmap UDP scan is (`-sU`)  

When a packet is sent to an open UDP port, there should be no response. When this happens, Nmap refers to the port as being `open|filtered`. In other words, it suspects that the port is open, but it could be firewalled. If it gets a UDP response (which is very unusual), then the port is marked as _open_. More commonly there is no response, in which case the request is sent a second time as a double-check. If there is still no response then the port is marked _open|filtered_ and Nmap moves on.  

When a packet is sent to a _closed_ UDP port, the target should respond with an ICMP (ping) packet containing a message that the port is unreachable. This clearly identifies closed ports, which Nmap marks as such and moves on.

## NSE scripts

The **N**map **S**cripting **E**ngine (NSE) is an incredibly powerful addition to Nmap, extending its functionality quite considerably. NSE Scripts are written in the _Lua_ programming language, and can be used to do a variety of things: from scanning for vulnerabilities, to automating exploits for them. The NSE is particularly useful for reconnaisance, however, it is well worth bearing in mind how extensive the script library is.

There are many categories available. Some useful categories include:

- `safe`:- Won't affect the target
- `intrusive`:- Not safe: likely to affect the target  
- `vuln`:- Scan for vulnerabilities
- `exploit`:- Attempt to exploit a vulnerability
- `auth`:- Attempt to bypass authentication for running services (e.g. Log into an FTP server anonymously)
- `brute`:- Attempt to bruteforce credentials for running services
- `discovery`:- Attempt to query running services for further information about the network (e.g. query an SNMP server).

A more exhaustive list can be found [here](https://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html).

In the next task we'll look at how to interact with the NSE and make use of the scripts in these categories.
