## What's Burp Suite?
Burp Suite is a set of cybersecurity tools used for web application security testing. It is developed by PortSwigger, and it is widely used by security professionals, ethical hackers, and penetration testers to identify and address vulnerabilities in web applications. Burp Suite provides a comprehensive platform for various stages of the web application security testing process.

## Modules

Whilst Burp Community has a relatively limited feature-set compared to the Professional edition, it still has many superb tools available. These include:  

- **Proxy:** The most well-known aspect of Burp Suite, the Burp Proxy allows us to intercept and modify requests/responses when interacting with web applications.
- **Repeater:** The second most well-known Burp feature -- [Repeater](https://tryhackme.com/room/burpsuiterepeater) -- allows us to capture, modify, then resend the same request numerous times. This feature can be absolutely invaluable, especially when we need to craft a payload through trial and error (e.g. in an SQLi -- **S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage **I**njection) or when testing the functionality of an endpoint for flaws.
- **Intruder:** Although harshly rate-limited in Burp Community, [Intruder](https://tryhackme.com/room/burpsuiteintruder) allows us to spray an endpoint with requests. This is often used for bruteforce attacks or to fuzz endpoints.
- **Decoder:** Though less-used than the previously mentioned features, [Decoder](https://tryhackme.com/room/burpsuiteom) still provides a valuable service when transforming data -- either in terms of decoding captured information, or encoding a payload prior to sending it to the target. Whilst there are other services available to do the same job, doing this directly within Burp Suite can be very efficient.  
- **Comparer:** As the name suggests, [Comparer](https://tryhackme.com/room/burpsuiteom) allows us to compare two pieces of data at either word or byte level. Again, this is not something that is unique to Burp Suite, but being able to send (potentially very large) pieces of data directly into a comparison tool with a single keyboard shortcut can speed things up considerably.  
- **Sequencer:** We usually use [Sequencer](https://tryhackme.com/room/burpsuiteom) when assessing the randomness of tokens such as session cookie values or other supposedly random generated data. If the algorithm is not generating secure random values, then this could open up some devastating avenues for attack.  

In addition to the myriad of in-built features, the Java codebase also makes it very easy to write extensions to add to the functionality of the Burp framework. These can be written in Java, Python (using the Java [Jython](https://www.jython.org/) interpreter), or Ruby (using the Java [JRuby](https://www.jruby.org/) interpreter). The Burp Suite [Extender](https://tryhackme.com/room/burpsuiteextender) module can quickly and easily load extensions into the framework, as well as providing a marketplace to download third-party modules (referred to as the "BApp Store"). Whilst many of these extensions require a professional license to download and add in, there are still a fair number that can be integrated with Burp Community. For example, we may wish to extend the inbuilt logging functionality of Burp Suite with the [Logger++](https://github.com/portswigger/logger-plus-plus) module.

## The Dashboard

In short, the Dashboard interface is split into four quadrants:

![The four quadrants of the burp dashboard labelled in anti-clockwise order, starting from the top left.](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/11202e4c73faa30a757f1439b63b85c6.png)  

1. <span style="color:#FF0000">The Tasks menu allows us to define background tasks that Burp Suite will run whilst we use the application. The Pro version would also allow us to create on-demand scans. The default "Live Passive Crawl" (which automatically logs the pages we visit) will be more than suitable for our uses in this module.</span>
2. <span style="color:#9eb505">The Event log tells us what Burp Suite is doing (e.g. starting the Proxy), as well as information about any connections that we are making through Burp.</span>
3. <span style="color:#0419d1">The Issue Activity section is exclusive to Burp Pro. It won't give us anything using Burp Community, but in Burp Professional it would list all of the vulnerabilities found by the automated scanner. These would be ranked by severity and filterable by how sure Burp is that the component is vulnerable.</span>
4. <span style="color:#42f54e">The Advisory section gives more information about the vulnerabilities found, as well as references and suggested remediations. These could then be exported into a report.  
   Clicking on one of the example vulnerabilities in the Issue Activity section gives us an idea of what this looks like:  </span>

![The Advisory section showing the example OS Command Injection vulnerability advisories|665](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/a1e27d91bd58a0038fd0a5902a66f5b9.png)

## Navigation

Navigating around the Burp Suite GUI by default is done entirely using the top menu bars:

![The Burp Suite navigation bar showing the sub-tabs available in Burp Proxy](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/cb50d9d010fd277b7ce2c9acf2481125.png)  

These allow you to switch between modules (along the top row of the attached image). If the selected module has more than one sub-tab, then these can be selected using a second menu bar which appears directly below the original bar (the bottom row of the image above). It is common for module-specific settings to be provided in these sub-tabs (as is the case with the Proxy Options above).  

Tabs can also be popped out into separate windows should you prefer to view multiple tabs separately. This can be done by clicking "Window" in the application menu at the top of the screen, then choosing to "Detach" tabs:

![Demonstration of the menu allowing you to detach windows](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/87c7b704d11abbed8e059a0d33672613.png) 
These can be reattached in the same way.  

In addition to the menu bar, Burp Suite also has keyboard shortcuts that allow quick navigation to key tabs. By default, these are:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Shortcut**|**Does**|
|`Ctrl + Shift + D`|Switch to the Dashboard|
|`Ctrl + Shift + T`|Switch to the Target tab|
|`Ctrl + Shift + P   `|Switch to the Proxy tab|
|`Ctrl + Shift + I   `|Switch to the Intruder tab|
|`Ctrl + Shift + R   `|Switch to the Repeater tab|

## Options

- **Global Settings**: These settings affect the entire Burp Suite installation and are applied every time you start the application. They provide a baseline configuration for your Burp Suite environment.
    
- **Project Settings**: These settings are specific to the current project and apply only during the session. However, please note that Burp Suite Community Edition does not support saving projects, so any project-specific options will be lost when you close Burp.
    
    To access the settings, click on the **Settings** button in the top navigation bar. This will open a separate settings window.
    
    ![Settings button to open the separate settings window](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/40a3ea01d6eadc91d98499c3f921c90f.png)
    
    Below is the image showing the separate settings window. ![Separate settings window](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/8a6df0ac968a5c33e91903b350253b6b.png)

In the Settings window, you will find a menu on the left-hand side. This menu allows you to switch between different types of settings, including:

1. **Search**: Enables searching for specific settings using keywords.
2. **Type filter**: Filters the settings for **User** and **Project** options.
    - **User settings**: Shows settings that affect the entire Burp Suite installation.
    - **Project settings**: Displays settings specific to the current project.
3. **Categories**: Allows selecting settings by category.

![Project settings button](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/645b19f5d5848d004ab9c9e2/room-content/04cf1a4164616772d9495a3ee2bfd10a.png)  

It's worth noting that many tools within Burp Suite provide shortcuts to specific categories of settings. For example, the **Proxy** module includes a **Proxy settings** button that opens the settings window directly to the relevant proxy section.

The search feature on the settings page is a valuable addition, allowing you to quickly search for settings using keywords.

Take some time to familiarise yourself with the range of configurable options in Burp Suite. Once you are comfortable, you can proceed with the exercises related to configuring Burp Suite settings.


# Example:

Here are the steps to configure the Burp Suite Proxy with FoxyProxy:

1. **Install FoxyProxy:** Download and install the [FoxyProxy Basic extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-basic/).
    
    **Note: FoxyProxy is already installed on the AttackBox.**
    
2. **Access FoxyProxy Options:** Once installed, a button will appear at the top right of the Firefox browser. Click on the FoxyProxy button to access the FoxyProxy options pop-up.
    
    ![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/fee3f150ebb4d9301023188fddc0458a.png)
    
3. **Create Burp Proxy Configuration:** In the FoxyProxy options pop-up, click the **Options** button. This will open a new browser tab with the FoxyProxy configurations. Click the **Add** button to create a new proxy configuration.
    
    ![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/5a73425b5de3395c5db2962b9d613506.png)
    
4. **Add Proxy Details:** On the "Add Proxy" page, fill in the following values:
    
    - Title: `Burp` (or any preferred name)
    - Proxy IP: `127.0.0.1`
    - Port: `8080`
    
      
    
    ![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/b2d6f2b724f123070ca434bf2759df91.png)
    
5. **Save Configuration:** Click **Save** to save the Burp Proxy configuration.
    
6. **Activate Proxy Configuration:** Click on the FoxyProxy icon at the top-right of the Firefox browser and select the `Burp` configuration. This will redirect your browser traffic through `127.0.0.1:8080`. Note that Burp Suite must be running for your browser to make requests when this configuration is activated.

7. **Enable Proxy Intercept in Burp Suite:** Switch to Burp Suite and ensure that Intercept is turned on in the **Proxy** tab.
    
    ![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/645b19f5d5848d004ab9c9e2/room-content/9e0f6f47486737deff0e16c4e066120f.png)


## Scoping and Targeting

Finally, we come to one of the most important aspects of using the Burp Proxy: **Scoping**.

Capturing and logging all of the traffic can quickly become overwhelming and inconvenient, especially when we only want to focus on specific web applications. This is where scoping comes in.

By setting a scope for the project, we can define what gets proxied and logged in Burp Suite. We can restrict Burp Suite to target only the specific web application(s) we want to test. The easiest way to do this is by switching to the `Target` tab, right-clicking on our target from the list on the left, and selecting `Add To Scope`. Burp will then prompt us to choose whether we want to stop logging anything that is not in scope, and in most cases, we want to select `yes`.

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/645b19f5d5848d004ab9c9e2/room-content/5db0a2b0597830ae32aaaf9b80d73187.gif)  

To check our scope, we can switch to the **Scope settings** sub-tab within the **Target** tab.

The Scope settings window allows us to control our target scope by including or excluding domains/IPs. This section is powerful and worth spending time getting familiar with.

However, even if we disabled logging for out-of-scope traffic, the proxy will still intercept everything. To prevent this, we need to go to the **Proxy settings** sub-tab and select `And` `URL` `Is in target scope` from the "Intercept Client Requests" section.

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/645b19f5d5848d004ab9c9e2/room-content/97db105960dfe71e42855461e3ef0de2.png)  

Enabling this option ensures that the proxy completely ignores any traffic that is not within the defined scope, resulting in a cleaner traffic view in Burp Suite.


## Proxying HTTPS


When intercepting HTTP traffic, we may encounter an issue when navigating to sites with TLS enabled. For example, when accessing a site like `https://google.com/`, we may receive an error indicating that the PortSwigger Certificate Authority (CA) is not authorised to secure the connection. This happens because the browser does not trust the certificate presented by Burp Suite.

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/8b4b43cac91cd9a80622b953598d05eb.png)

To overcome this issue, we can manually add the PortSwigger CA certificate to our browser's list of trusted certificate authorities. Here's how to do it:

1. **Download the CA Certificate:** With the Burp Proxy activated, navigate to http://burp/cert. This will download a file called `cacert.der`. Save this file somewhere on your machine.
    
2. **Access Firefox Certificate Settings:** Type `about:preferences` into your Firefox URL bar and press **Enter**. This will take you to the Firefox settings page. Search the page for "certificates" and click on the **View Certificates** button.
    
    ![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/a9de0495b2ac6738520c8f9946afdecb.png)
    
3. **Import the CA Certificate:** In the Certificate Manager window, click on the **Import** button. Select the `cacert.der` file that you downloaded in the previous step.
    
4. **Set Trust for the CA Certificate:** In the subsequent window that appears, check the box that says "Trust this CA to identify websites" and click OK.
    
    ![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5d9e176315f8850e719252ed/room-content/23e5cb317d00c1a5e64def1d46fa9301.png)
    

By completing these steps, we have added the PortSwigger CA certificate to our list of trusted certificate authorities. Now, we should be able to visit any TLS-enabled site without encountering the certificate error.

You can watch the following video for a visual demonstration of the full certificate import process:
